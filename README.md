# LibHub: Collaborative C++ Library Repository

LibHub is an open-source project aimed at creating a collaborative repository of C++ libraries contributed by developers from around the world. The project's goal is to provide a centralized platform where developers can share their C++ libraries, enabling the community to benefit from a diverse collection of useful and well-documented code.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from C++ enthusiasts who want to share their libraries with the community. To contribute your library, please follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Create a new branch for your library: `git checkout -b library-name`.
3. Add your library code to the appropriate directory within the repository structure.
4. Include a README file within your library directory, providing documentation and usage examples.
5. Commit your changes and push the branch to your forked repository.
6. Open a pull request against the `main` branch of this repository.
7. Ensure that your library adheres to our contribution guidelines (link to guidelines file or section).

## Contribution Guidelines

To maintain a high standard of quality and consistency, we have established the following contribution guidelines:

- Ensure that your library is well-documented and includes clear usage instructions.
- Use a consistent coding style and follow best practices for C++ development.
- Include appropriate testing and provide instructions on how to run the tests.
- Avoid dependencies on proprietary or non-open-source libraries.
- Choose an open-source license for your library and include the license information in your README file.
- Be responsive to feedback and actively engage with the community.

## Repository Structure

The CppHub repository is structured as follows:

/
|-- Library1/
|   |-- library1.cpp
|   |-- library1.h
|   |-- README.md
|-- Library2/
|   |-- library2.cpp
|   |-- library2.h
|   |-- README.md
|-- ...
|-- CONTRIBUTING.md
|-- LICENSE
|-- README.md

Please add your library code to the appropriate directory along with a README.md file that provides documentation and usage instructions for your library.
